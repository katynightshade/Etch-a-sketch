# etch-a-sketch
This project will display higher-level JavaScript skills, including research as needed to complete tasks unknown. I will be creating a browser version of an etch-a-sketch/sketchpad.

This project tested my ability to use all three languages in heavy conjunction with one another. It also tested my DOM manipulation skills. This project was very challenging, but built my repertoire of ideas and concepts to use in future projects. I also feel like I hit my stride with using Github for my workflow, including using Linux command line on my desktop and using GitHub desktop on my laptop (Windows OS). I got the hang of adding and commiting when I reached significant points in my code.

Reflections: 
 - The way that things are nexted within JavaScript can make or break your code. 
 - Always proofread code before getting frustrated that it is not working, ensuring that references between documents are accurate. 
 - CSS is an asset to all front end coding, despite the cool things that JavaScript can do! 
 - Don't be afraid to look at and test other people's code to see if they have something that can work in your code, especially if you're working on something new.
 - Use the resources that are available to you; Research what you need to (Google/DuckDuckGo) and if you cannot find an answer, ask someone your (well-structured) questions. Discord is a great resource for this.
